# CPPGAME
cppgame is a C++20 game development framework designed to simplify the creation and management of 2D games. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and abstractions to handle common game development tasks, such as window management, rendering, scene management, and game object manipulation. The library is structured to be modular and extensible, allowing developers to focus on game logic rather than low-level details.
